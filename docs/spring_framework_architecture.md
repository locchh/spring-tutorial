### Spring Framework Architecture

Here's a table summarizing the architecture of the **Spring Framework** with key modules and their responsibilities:

| **Module**      | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Core Module** | Provides the fundamental parts of the framework, including IoC (Inversion of Control) and Dependency Injection (DI) containers. Core interfaces like `BeanFactory` and `ApplicationContext` are here. |
| **AOP Module**  | Supports Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) to separate cross-cutting concerns (like logging, security). Integrates with AspectJ.                                                                      |
| **DAO Module**  | Simplifies database access using JDBC abstraction, managing exceptions and boilerplate code. It provides a consistent exception hierarchy.                                                            |
| **ORM Module**  | Integrates with popular Object-Relational Mapping tools such as Hibernate, JPA, and JDO to simplify data persistence.                                                                                 |
| **JEE Module**  | Provides support for Java EE features like JavaMail, JNDI, EJB, and scheduling. Allows easier integration with enterprise services.                                                                   |
| **Web Module**  | Enables web application development, including Spring MVC for building RESTful and web applications. Contains `DispatcherServlet` and view resolvers.                                                 |
