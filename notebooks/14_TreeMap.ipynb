If you try to insert the duplicate key, it will replace the element of the corresponding key. It is easy to perform operations using the key index like updation, deletion, etc. HashMap class is found in the java.util package.\n",

    "HashMap in Java is like the legacy Hashtable class, but it is not synchronized. It allows us to store the null elements as well, but there should be only one null key. Since Java 5, it is denoted as HashMap<K,V>, where K stands for key and V for value. It inherits the AbstractMap class and implements the Map interface.\n",

    "This class provides the easiest way to harness the power of weak references. It is useful for implementing \"registry-like\" data structures, where the utility of an entry vanishes when its key is no longer reachable by any thread.\n",

    "The WeakHashMap functions identically to the HashMap with one very important exception: if the Java memory manager no longer has a strong reference to the object specified as a key, then the entry in the map will be removed.\n",

It belongs to java.util package and It is an extension of SortedMap which provides convenient navigation methods like lowerKey, floorKey, ceilingKey and higherKey, and along with this popular navigation method. It also provide ways to create a Sub Map from existing Map in Java e.g. headMap whose keys are less than the specified key, tailMap whose keys are greater than the specified key, and a subMap which strictly contains keys which fall between toKey and fromKey. \n",

    "The TreeMap in Java is used to implement Map interface and NavigableMap along with the AbstractMap Class. The map is sorted according to the natural ordering of its keys, or by a Comparator provided at map creation time, depending on which constructor is used. This proves to be an efficient way of sorting and storing the key-value pairs. The storing order maintained by the treemap must be consistent with equals just like any other sorted map, irrespective of the explicit comparators. The treemap implementation is not synchronized in the sense that if a map is accessed by multiple threads, concurrently and at least one of the threads modifies the map structurally, it must be synchronized externally. \n",

    "ConcurrentHashMap is a thread-safe implementation of the Map interface in Java, which means multiple threads can access it simultaneously without any synchronization issues.
